**The Minimum Wage and Inequality Between Groups**
with Francine Blau, [Matthew Comey](https://www.matthewcomey.com/), Lawrence Kahn, and [Nikolai Boboshko](https://nboboshko.github.io/)

Latest Version: September 2023 

[Paper](https://isaac-cohen.github.io/files/mw_bg_inequality_bcckb.pdf) \| [Appendix](https://isaac-cohen.github.io/files/mw_bg_inequality_appendix_bcckb.pdf) \| [NBER Working Paper](https://www.nber.org/papers/w31725) \| Replication Package (Coming Soon)

We use wage data from the Current Population Survey Merged Outgoing Rotation Group (CPS MORG) to study the effect of state and federal minimum wage policies on gender, race, and ethnic inequality throughout the wage distribution, focusing on lower-tail inequality between men and women, Blacks and Whites, and Hispanics and Whites. We use estimates from three empirical strategies — two reduced-form, one structural — to provide counterfactual simulations of between-group inequality over four key “epochs” of minimum wage policy changes since 1979. Declines in the real minimum wage during the 1980s slowed progress in narrowing between-group inequality during that period. Fairly muted shifts in national and state policies from 1989 to 1998 and 1998 to 2007 meant that the minimum wage was less important over those time spans. Since 2007, several states have opted for steep minimum wage hikes, which we find have especially improved Hispanics’ relative wages, both because they continue to earn low wages and because they reside disproportionately in those states. Finally, we make predictions about the effect of raising the federal minimum wage to $12. We find that a change of this magnitude would reduce existing between-group wage gaps below the 15th percentile by 25-50% and would therefore have an economically important impact on gender, racial, and ethnic inequality in the present day.

**Demand for Social Security: Evidence from Patchwork Coverage**
with [Andrew Johnston](https://sites.google.com/site/andrewjohnstoneconomics/)

*Paper coming soon!*

By historical quirk, public schools in Georgia have a patchwork of Social Security coverage, which we use to measure worker demand for the program. When transferring schools, teachers exchange Social Security coverage for 3.4 percent of salary on average, implying the marginal transfer values coverage at about half the employer cost and a portion of the full social cost. Evidence from teacher flows between districts using a gravity model also suggests a low valuation of coverage with teachers avoiding covered employment, conditional on pay and student demographics. Our setting provides the first empirical estimates to quantify Hicksian transfers for Social Security reform.
